# Flaschenpost

Job Application

## Description

Create a Web-Site that

- acts both as a mobile and desktop optimized web-page to display products
  (see mocks below).
- feel free to design and/or choose an appealing layout based on the mocks yourself.
- use the URL of our API below to get product data including URLs to images.
- is responsive whereas the layout can go up to a maximum width of 1260 pixels, centered on
  the screen.
- can switch between two different styles of views as seen in the mocks below via a button at
  the top bar. The two options are:

  - The detail view (default). Which includes Image, Name and Price.
  - The bottle view. Which renders only the images (which are all bottles) next to each
    other.

- offers a button to sort the result by price and toggle ascending and descending order.
- offers a toggle button to filter out beers which are more expensive than 2 euro per litre.

  You are invited to use and include whatever assets you find from our actual websites (as long as you
  donâ€™t host them publicly) to further style and beautify this project. You may use any tools that you
  like to accomplish this task, including build/dependency management, IDE/editor, libraries, etc.
  We should be able to build and run your project without needing to make any changes to it. Feel free
  to provide a very simple set of instructions on how to start the project.
  The URL for the JSON-Data is the following:
